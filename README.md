# Airline Delay Analysis Using MapReduce and Spark

This repository contains a comparative analysis of airline delay data using two different big data processing frameworks: MapReduce and Spark. The objective is to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of each framework in handling large datasets, specifically focusing on airline delay incidents.

## About the Project

The project aims to explore and analyze the patterns and reasons behind airline delays. By leveraging the capabilities of MapReduce and Spark, we aim to uncover insights that can help in mitigating such delays and improving airline performance.

### Data Set

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset includes detailed records of flight delays and their attributes.

- **Data Source**: [Flight Delay EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adveros/flight-delay-eda-exploratory-data-analysis/notebook)

### Technologies Used

- **MapReduce**: A programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.
- **Apache Spark**: An open-source, distributed computing system that provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have either Hadoop (for MapReduce) or Apache Spark installed on your system or cluster.
2. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
3. Follow the instructions in the project files to process the data using both MapReduce and Spark.

## Analysis Results

The findings from the analysis are summarized in the repository, showcasing the performance and outcomes of using MapReduce versus Spark for this specific dataset.
